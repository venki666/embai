## Collecting real data and performing some basic ML modeling

### What do we do in this Session (Day 5.2)

Codes @ http://github.com/venki666/embai

*Task 1*

- Collect raw data using the code IMU_SD_serialtrigger.ino
- Perform Data Analysis using m5imu_data_analysis.py
- What does the above program do?
  
*Task 2*

Collect smooth data using the code IMU_SD_ST_AGEQ.ino for a slow-moving action. What does the program do?
Estimate the roll using the below methods and perform comparison to the ground-truth – How is ground-truth evaluated?
- Linear Regression
- Non-Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest 
- SVM Regression
- MLP NN Regression

### What should be in your report/wiki?

*Task 1*
- Process of collecting raw IMU data
- Why perform smoothing, filtering of raw IMU data?
- What is preformed in feature extraction?
- Comment on the analysis performed? Use and need?

*Task2*
- Process of collecting smooth IMU data
- What is R2 metrics?
- Description of different regression algorithms.
- Compare the performance of different regression algorithms.
- Which algorithm is the best?
